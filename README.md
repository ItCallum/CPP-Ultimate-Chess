# Ultimate-Chess
Implementation of an inheritance hierarchy and use of polymorphism in C++ and introduce ideas of collision detection in computer games. 

An important topic in many computer games is determining when 2 object collide with one another. In this project I have created a basic chess game with the 3 pieces Rook, Bishop and  Queen  stored in an  appropriate  inheritance  hierarchy from Piece. Pieces are on cords (not squares) and can move a random distance. Each piece has a space and a check will be done to see if any two shapes overlap.

A test is was created that creates and stores several pieces in an array or list and then plays a gane with them.
